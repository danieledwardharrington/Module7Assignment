/*
High interest rate checking class
As far as I can tell, I don't have to actually do anything with this class.
I think the legwork for deciding which account to use, the high interest checking
and no service checking, will come down to the main.cpp file with certain rules set
up there. If it's taking user input, then there would have to be if statements to handle
which account to choose.
